            From April 2017, the laws changed allowing business & charities to
            seek better deals for water. This change has created competition in
            the non-domestic water market with more retail suppliers entering
            the marker every year.
            <br />
            <br />
            The law changes means that companies in England and Scotland can
            switch their business water supplier. However, in Wales, businesses
            are only allowed to switch if consumption is over 5000mÂ³ of water
            per year. To be eligible to switch water supplier, the registered
            business address must meet the location requirements.
