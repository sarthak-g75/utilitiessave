                When we receive a complaint from you, we initiate the following
                in order to resolve your complaint: We will consider your
                complaint by the close of business on the third working day
                after receiving your complaint and, if possible, provide a
                suitable verbal explanation within the time frame. lf we cannot
                resolve your complaint by the third business day we will, within
                five working days, provide you with a written acknowledgement of
                receipt of your complaint and will also endeavour to provide a
                resolution by then. lf we have been unable to resolve your
                complaint by this time, we will advise you when <br /> <br />
                We expect to be able to reach a conclusion, with the aim of
                providing a final resolution as soon as possible. lf a final
                response cannot be completed within eight weeks, we will mail
                you explaining why we are not in a position to provide a final
                response â€“ and we will advise when we would be able to provide
                one. <br />
                <br /> We will still inform you that you have a choice to refer
                the complaint to the Ombudsman service if you are dissatisfied
                with the explanation for our delay.
